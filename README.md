# gofm

A small terminal CLI for checking a Last.fm user's recent tracks.

`gofm` is a minimal Go command-line app that talks to the Last.fm API, stores your local config, and prints recent listening history in a clean terminal format.

## What you get

- Automatic first-run setup for your Last.fm username and API key
- Local config stored in your XDG config directory
- Recent-track lookup for your saved user or any username you pass explicitly
- Simple single-binary workflow
- No auth flow or session handling required for read-only lookups

## Install

### Option 1: Download from Releases

Open [Releases](https://github.com/theOldZoom/gofm/releases) and download the file for your system:

| I use...              | Download this file  |
| --------------------- | ------------------- |
| Linux (x86_64)        | `gofm-linux-amd64`  |
| Linux (ARM64)         | `gofm-linux-arm64`  |
| macOS (Intel)         | `gofm-darwin-amd64` |
| macOS (Apple Silicon) | `gofm-darwin-arm64` |
| Windows (x86_64)      | `gofm-windows-amd64.exe` |
| Windows (ARM64)       | `gofm-windows-arm64.exe` |

Then make it executable and run it:

```bash
chmod +x gofm-linux-amd64
./gofm-linux-amd64 recent
```

### Option 2: Install to `~/.local/bin`

This installs the latest matching release as `~/.local/bin/gofm`:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/theoldzoom/gofm/master/install.sh | sh
```

If `~/.local/bin` is already in your `PATH`, you can then run:

```bash
gofm recent
```

### Option 3: Build from source

You need [Go](https://go.dev/) installed.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/theOldZoom/gofm.git
cd gofm
make build
./build/gofm recent
```

## Usage

If no config exists yet, `gofm` launches interactive setup and saves your details to:

```text
~/.config/gofm/config.yaml
```

Example config:

```yaml
username: your_lastfm_username
api_key: your_lastfm_api_key
```

### API key

`gofm` needs a Last.fm API key for requests to the Last.fm API.

Create one here:

[Last.fm API account page](https://www.last.fm/api/account/create)

or view your accounts here:

[https://www.last.fm/api/accounts](https://www.last.fm/api/accounts)



## Notes

- Recent tracks are fetched from the Last.fm `user.getRecentTracks` endpoint
- First-run setup validates both your API key and username before saving config
- Use `--config` to point to a custom config file if needed
- `gofm` also reads environment variables through Viper, so `USERNAME` and `API_KEY` can be used as fallbacks
- The project currently focuses on read-only lookups

---

## Tech stack

- [Go](https://go.dev/)
- [Cobra](https://github.com/spf13/cobra) for the CLI
- [Viper](https://github.com/spf13/viper) for configuration
- `net/http` from the Go standard library for API requests

---

## TODO

- Add a `now` command for currently playing tracks
- Add top artists and top tracks commands
- Improve terminal formatting for track output
- Support JSON output for scripting
- Add tests for config loading and API calls
